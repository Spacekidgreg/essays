Streaming services have come a long way since they first provided an affordable way of getting access to a wide range of entertainment content. Netflix took the lead, evolving from a 1990s DVD rental service to a multi-platform streaming powerhouse. However, as technology developed, streaming services multiplied as well. The situation has changed now that there are more than six main platforms, including Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and others. What was once considered a luxury has evolved into a daily need, creating questions regarding accessibility for low-income people.

Convenience is a major selling factor for streaming services. The days of needing to buy individual DVDs or waiting for a specific time window to view your favorite show are long gone. With streaming, users can select what they want to watch, when they want to watch it, and how much control they want—all with the click of a button. This degree of accessibility has changed media consumption by enabling people to choose the entertainment they want to see. The comfort of streaming across multiple devices first seemed affordable compared to pricey cable packages because the cost of multiple subscriptions was comparable to cable at that time (Spangler, T. 2023, November 8). Now, we have an increasing number of subscription-based business models in various areas, including music, grocery stores, and news articles, which adds to the financial burden. 

The main issue isn't with streaming services per se; instead, it's with the business decisions motivated by profit. Price increases exceed inflation rates, and the initial appeal of ad-free viewing is diminished with the appearance of advertisements. Businesses defend these moves by saying they must invest in high-quality content and recover costs caused by the pandemic. But in the end, customers are the ones who suffer—they have to pay more and have less enjoyable viewing experiences. Before it's too late, this topic needs to be discussed because streaming services are not getting any less expensive in addition to being widely available. With all our current subscriptions, Netflix alone will cost you more than $250 a year. You start to notice that grocery stores are beginning to implement these strategies. For example, Walmart offers Walmart Plus, which provides better benefits than a non-subscription plan (Lemire, S. 2024, March 7). However, the company doesn't stop there; to reduce self-checkout users, Walmart is now attempting to charge $12 per month or $98 annually nationwide. This is because the company was not paying its employees, but it was also noticing that theft cost them more than just paying their employees. (Lemire, S. 2024, March 7). 
Companies use strategies like tier-based memberships and price increases to capitalize on the increased demand for materials related to the pandemic. Concerns about licensing and the availability of their favorite shows affect customers. Customers were affected, for instance, when Netflix lost the rights to "Family Guy," highlighting the drawbacks of getting their entertainment only from certain streaming providers. (Moore, K. February 4, 2024). It is still accessible today after being purchased by Hulu, another streaming service. Since modern businesses would never put their customer's interests ahead of their own, the only person who suffers is the customer, who must catch up on particular shows and movies they want to see. 

Again, the main issue isn't with streaming services per se; rather, it's with business decisions that are motivated by profit. It is crucial to balance customers' interests and revenue when negotiating the complicated world of streaming services. Companies are entitled to make money, but they also have a responsibility to ensure that everyone can continue to use and purchase their services. This requires reconsidering pricing strategies, making structural investments to boost internet connectivity, and prioritizing consumer choice and transparency. 

October 2023 saw pricing increases for six major corporations, including Apple TV (Spangler, T. 2023, November 8). The average price increased by 23% on all 7 of the big platforms, which is significantly more than the 3.7% 12-month inflation rate for the US as of September (Spangler, T. 2023, November 8). Because of all the advertisements on their site, companies have made it more challenging to understand what is true and what is a PR tactic. Netflix used to be known for saying, "No advertising coming onto Netflix. Period,". They marketed all of that quite well because, despite everything, everyone could watch shows without any restrictions, and everyone had the same price (Otterson, J. 2015, June 2). However, these days, businesses need to make up for the money they lost during the pandemic, as well as improve movie production and strike good deals with other show and movie companies to beat the competition, which is why we see Netflix and now other companies trying to cut down on sharing accounts. 

In conclusion, the development of streaming services has unquestionably changed how we consume media by providing outstanding convenience and flexibility. However, as these services become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, concerns regarding accessibility and affordability remain. By addressing these issues head-on and putting customer demands first, we can create a more welcoming and sustainable future for the streaming business.
